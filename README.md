# COL216-ARM-processor-in-VHDL

I have designed hardware for implementing a processor that can execute ARM instructions. The designs are expressed in VHDL and then simulated and synthesized. Included modules for ALU, Register File, Memory, Program Counter, Multiplier, Shifter and for updating and checking flags. 

Starting with a skeleton design, the hardware is built in several stages, adding some functionality at every stage. You can view the 8 stages and see the readme in each folder to understand the extra functionalities added in that stage from the previous stage.
